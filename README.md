# Power-BI
A full project done on power bi desktop

### Introduction
I noticed that there's no single day without a single accident case, so I dexided to make researches on the factors causing these accidents using the little knowledge I've acquired over time.

### Stakeholder Requiremts / problem statements;

### Power BI Cncepts applied
. DAX Concepts; Calculated columns, calculated measures.

. Data modelling; star schema(*:1).

. Grouping of some columns.

### Data Cleaning
Noticed that there was a typo error in the "accident severity" column, instead of fatal, a user registered it as fetal. So i had to use the "replace values" option in the power query editor so as to avoid having a wrong category in the column.

### Data Transformation
. A new Date Table was created so as to meet the stakeholder's requirements.
